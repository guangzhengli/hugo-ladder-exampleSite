Dynamic websites are server-based(or serverless), which can return different content depending on the user. They rely on a content management system (CMS) or database for rendering. So you need to pay for server costs.\nStatic sites generally display the same content to all users. They use server-side rendering to serve HTML, CSS, and Javascript files, which use static site generators (SSG) technology to display the same content to all users. The advantages of a static site include speed, security and SEO. it is also easy to maintain and highly scalable. Since Static Site Generators (SSG) store an already compiled page on a CDN, they load much faster.\nWe can choose to host to CDNs or platforms for free Netlify, Heroku, GoDaddy, DreamHost, GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, Surge, Firebase, Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Rackspace, Azure, CloudFront.\nThese are among the common SSG solutions: Hexo, Jekyll, Hugo or Next. js.\nHexo is Node.js based with support for multiple templating engines, integrations with NPM packages, and one command deployment. But it lacks detailed documentation when develop custom themes.\nJekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby and uses the Liquid templating language, has a vast plugin ecosystem, and is known to be beginner-friendly. One of the challenges when working with Jekyll can be the requirement of having a whole Ruby development environment to build your site.\nNext.js is a awesome technology but I found that Next.js is not perfect in the plugin ecosystem of development blogs at the moment.\nAfter comparing these technologies, I finally choose Hugo. Hugo is a fast, modern static website generator written in golang. It renders 5000 articles a second in benchmark tests and has a vast plugin ecosystem.\nInstallation To install Hugo you can follow the documentation step by step hugo install. You can also follow the command below to install it quickly.\nMacOS / Linux brew install hugo Window choco install hugo -confirm You can ensure the installation is successful by using hugo version.\nInstall the theme Ladder The theme of this blog is called ladder, which means reading as input and writing as output, both are ladders to gain knowledge.\nHugo Ladder repository URL：https://github.com/guangzhengli/hugo-theme-ladder\nAn already configured repository URL is: https://github.com/guangzhengli/hugo-ladder-exampleSite\nIf you want to practice with the hugo command or develop this theme, you can start with #configuration initialization step by step.\nIf you don’t want to use hugo command, you can just clone already repository and then hugo server -D, and open http://localhost:1313/ in your browser. then you can jump directly to #Custom Configuration. No need to do configuration initialization.\ngit clone https://github.com/guangzhengli/hugo-ladder-exampleSite.git hugo server -D configuration initialization Hugo provides a new command to create a new website:\nhugo new site my_website cd my_website create an empty git repository and make this repository a submodule of your site directory:\ngit init git submodule add https://github.com/guangzhengli/hugo-theme-ladder themes/ladder Because of my personal preference for yml format reading, this theme uses yml instead of the default toml format type to configure, so you can go to transform.tool to convert according to your preference.\nHere is all configuration in the config.yml, you can delete the default config.toml file in the root directory and create a new config.yml file instead.\nclick here to show config.yml file baseURL: 'https://hugo-ladder.pages.dev' title: LADDER theme: hugo-theme-ladder license: MIT licenselink: 'https://github.com/guangzhengli/hugo-theme-ladder/blob/master/LICENSE' description: 'A fast, clean Hugo theme' homepage: 'https://hugo-ladder.pages.dev' defaultContentLanguage: 'en' googleAnalytics: G-xxx paginate: 10 params: brand: HOME avatarURL: /images/avatar.png author: Hugo Ladder authorDescription: A clean, fast hugo theme focused on Reading info: Build a free and beautiful blog site to record your thoughts and increase your influence favicon: /images/avatar.png options: showDarkMode: true enableImgZooming: true enableMultiLang: true darkModeTheme: data-dark-mode #darkModeTheme: icy-dark-mode comments: giscus: enable: true repo: username/repo repo_id: xxx category: Announcements category_id: xxx mapping: pathname position: top lang: en # pick a language from https://github.com/giscus/giscus/tree/main/locales utteranc: enable: false repo: username/xxx issueTerm: pathname analytics: google: SiteVerificationTag: xxx umami: enable: true website_id: xxx url: https://xxx guestbook: title: Guestbook description: Leave a comment below.

Copy themes/ladder/exampleSite/content file to content in the root directory.\nCreate a new blog post named my-first-blog\nhugo new blog/my-first-blog.md Once created, you can use hugo server -D to build and run the blog and open http://localhost:1313/ in your browser to see your blog site.\nCustom Configuration multi language support First, we need to determine which language is the default language of the blog website. Is it multi-language support? For example, defaultContentLanguage needs to be set to en if the default language is English. If the default language is Chinese it is zh.\nIn addition, if you don’t need multi-language support, set params.options.enableMultiLang to false, and delete the other language configuration which below the languages.\nmodify the basic configuration baseURL: 'https://hugo-ladder.pages.dev' #change to your https://username.github.io homepage: 'https://hugo-ladder.pages.dev' #change to your https://username.github.io params: brand: HOME # change to your brand of blog site avatarURL: /images/avatar.png # change /static/images/ file author: Hugo Ladder # your name authorDescription: # your desc info: # website info favicon: /images/avatar.png # website favicon options: showDarkMode: true # dark mode support You can open http://localhost:1313/ in your browser to see the result in real time while you modify it.\nnavigation Currently this blog supports 4 default pages, blogs list, tags, history archives and guestbook.\nYou can adjust the name by modifying menu.main, if you want to add a new page in the navigation bar, remember to add the corresponding markdown file under content in the root directory.\nDark mode Here are to dark mode theme currently, one is the default data-dark-mode theme, and the other is icy-dark-mode dark theme. Which can be replaced by modifying the value of params.darkModeTheme.\nSocial Icon New social icons can be added by modifying the configuration file, the params.social field specifies name, icon, custom address and the icon can be found at this website feathericons.com.\nContent management posts management If you create a new posts, it is recommended to fill the configuration which means:\ntitle: date: {{ .Date }} tags: [] series: [] featured: true title post title date published date tags tags series series, it will be show related post below the content. featured it will be show in home page featured post, true or false Rich content This theme integrates Toggle and Tab group by default, The Toggle can hide code or content in #Configuration initialization, and the Tab group can toggle tabs to write content in #Install Hugo for example.\nIn addition, there are rich content such as youtube, twitter and site page jump integration. You can check rich content for details.\nI also created a new repository https://github.com/guangzhengli/awesome-hugo-shortcodes to collect hugo shortcodes, you can go see if there are any you need, you can add them yourself.\nGuestBook and comment integration The guestbook and comments feature supports based on GitHub Issues for utteranc, and other based on GitHub Discussions for giscus\nThe steps to integrate both are simple, just follow the tutorials of utteranc and giscus, generate the configuration values and fill in the value of giscus in params.comments. This theme used giscus, and set false to utteranc.enbale.\nWeb analytics The theme ladder can be integrated with Google analytics and umami for two kinds of web analytics.\nFor Google analytics you can get the MEASUREMENT ID which start with G-xxx to the googleAnalytics parameters from the document.\nThe integration of Google analytics is simple and free, but the disadvantage is that it is not privacy-protected (the data will upload to Google), and the analytics pages are slow.\nSo if you have the need to build umami to do the privacy-protected analytics, the process and steps I put in another blog How to build umami for free-to-use.\nSEO The theme has been optimized for SEO, including perfect meta tag information, etc. In addition, the default support Google Search Console, you can generate the google-site-verification to the params. analytics.google.SiteVerificationTag according to the document.\nDeploy There are also many ways to deploy, with the option of hosting to a CDN or platform Netlify、Heroku、GoDaddy、DreamHost、GitHub Pages、GitLab Pages、Surge、Firebase、Google Cloud Storage、Amazon S3、Rackspace、Azure and CloudFront 。\nIn this article, we have chosen the GitHub Pages for the tutorial.\nCreate GitHub account Before building our blog site, we need to register a GitHub account. The account username is very important, which is the domain address of our blog site.\nFor example, if we create an account with the username guangzhengli, we will get our blog site which address is https://guangzhengli.github.io.\nCreate repository for GitHub Pages You can find the full tutorial in the GitHub Pages Doc. It just need create a new repository with the repository name username.github.io.\nActions There two ways to deploy blog used GitHub pages, one is to push directly to GitHub Pages, and the other is to generate static page code on the gh-pages branch. The code is available at https://github.com/guangzhengli/hugo-ladder-exampleSite/tree/master/.github/workflows.\nIf you did not clone the configured repository: https://github.com/guangzhengli/hugo-ladder-exampleSite. You need to create a new folder .github/workflows and add the new file gh-pages.yml file.\nClick to show the code name: generate github pages to gh-pages branch on: push: branches: - main ## Set a branch name to trigger deployment jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-20.04 steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 with: submodules: true # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive) fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: 'latest' extended: true - name: Build run: hugo --minify - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 # If you're changing the branch from main, # also change the `main` in `refs/heads/main` # below accordingly. if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' with: github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} publish_dir: ./public Deploy GitHub Pages Enter the following command in the root directory of your project.\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git git add . git commit -m \"feat: init blog site\" git push origin main Once we’ve made sure our push is successful. It’ll automatically build the code into the files needed for GitHub Pages in Actions, so you can go to this address to check if workflow is running successfully. Be sure to replace username in the address with your account name. https://github.com/username/username.github.io/actions.\nIf Actions workflow successfully, we will have a new branch called gh-pages. Then go to the repository’s settings center Settings, select Pages, and then Build and deployment -\u003e Source and select Deploy from a branch. After that Branch select gh-pages to configure successfully.\nThen you can select Visit site to https://username.github.io for successful access! 🎉🎉🎉🎉\nIf you have any questions when deploying, you can leave a comment below.\nLink to original article: https://guangzhengli.com/en/blog/en/how-to-create-your-blog-for-free-by-hugo-ladder-in-30min/\n","wordCount":"2039","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-08-14T16:47:12+08:00","dateModified":"2022-08-14T16:47:12+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Hugo Ladder"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://hugo-ladder.pages.dev/blog/how-to-create-your-blog-for-free-by-hugo-ladder-in-30min/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"LADDER","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://hugo-ladder.pages.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script><link rel=icon type=image/png href=/images/avatar.png sizes=16x16><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=/images/avatar.png><link rel=manifest href=/images/avatar.png><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/main.min.f36ab2c33afcf6dff66b52a58a844cd4b056628be4cc34c249fd951b35d5a06a.css integrity="sha256-82qywzr89t/2a1KlioRM1LBWYovkzDTCSf2VGzXVoGo=" crossorigin=anonymous media=screen><link rel=stylesheet href=/scss/highlight/github-dark.min.min.66034289ee9a113219a2c4aae0a8bd2095ab255c832a42efcf5863f10814e7a1.css><script src=/js/highlight.min.min.698bc9ccb8ccaf7f58dc58847b72072cc4b88774110168045d5299bbaee4b1ca.js></script>

You can check <a href=https://hugo-ladder.pages.dev/blog/tag-plugins/>rich content</a> for details.</p><p>I also created a new repository <a href=https://github.com/guangzhengli/awesome-hugo-shortcodes>https://github.com/guangzhengli/awesome-hugo-shortcodes</a> to collect <code>hugo shortcodes</code>, you can go see if there are any you need, you can add them yourself.</p><h2 id=guestbook-and-comment-integration>GuestBook and comment integration</h2><p>The guestbook and comments feature supports based on <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/issues>GitHub Issues</a> for <a href=https://utteranc.es/>utteranc</a>, and other based on <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/discussions>GitHub Discussions</a> for <a href=https://giscus.app/>giscus</a></p><p>The steps to integrate both are simple, just follow the tutorials of <a href=https://utteranc.es/>utteranc</a> and <a href=https://giscus.app/>giscus</a>, generate the configuration values and fill in the value of <code>giscus</code> in <code>params.comments</code>. This theme used <code>giscus</code>, and set <code>false</code> to <code>utteranc.enbale</code>.</p><h2 id=web-analytics>Web analytics</h2><p>The theme ladder can be integrated with <a href=https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/>Google analytics</a> and <a href=https://umami.is/>umami</a> for two kinds of web analytics.</p><p>For <a href=https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/>Google analytics</a> you can get the <code>MEASUREMENT ID</code> which start with <code>G-xxx</code> to the <code>googleAnalytics</code> parameters from the document.</p><p>The integration of <a href=https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/>Google analytics</a> is simple and free, but the disadvantage is that it is not privacy-protected (the data will upload to Google), and the analytics pages are slow.</p><p>So if you have the need to build <a href=https://umami.is/>umami</a> to do the privacy-protected analytics, the process and steps I put in another blog <a href=https://hugo-ladder.pages.dev/blog/how-to-integrate-umami-for-free-to-blog-site/>How to build umami for free-to-use</a>.</p><h2 id=seo>SEO</h2><p>The theme has been optimized for <code>SEO</code>, including perfect <code>meta</code> tag information, etc. In addition, the default support <a href=https://search.google.com/search-console>Google Search Console</a>, you can generate the <code>google-site-verification</code> to the <code>params. analytics.google.SiteVerificationTag</code> according to the document.</p><h2 id=deploy>Deploy</h2><p>There are also many ways to deploy, with the option of hosting to a CDN or platform <a href=https://netlify.com/>Netlify</a>、<a href=https://www.heroku.com/>Heroku</a>、<a href=https://www.godaddy.com/>GoDaddy</a>、<a href=https://www.dreamhost.com/>DreamHost</a>、<a href=https://pages.github.com/>GitHub Pages</a>、<a href=https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/>GitLab Pages</a>、<a href=https://surge.sh/>Surge</a>、<a href=https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/>Firebase</a>、<a href=https://cloud.google.com/storage/>Google Cloud Storage</a>、<a href=https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>Amazon S3</a>、<a href=https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files>Rackspace</a>、<a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website>Azure</a> and <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/>CloudFront</a> 。</p><p>In this article, we have chosen the <a href=https://pages.github.com/>GitHub Pages</a> for the tutorial.</p><h3 id=create-githubhttpsgithubcom-account>Create <a href=https://github.com/>GitHub</a> account</h3><p>Before building our blog site, we need to register a <a href=https://github.com/>GitHub</a> account. The account username is very important, which is the domain address of our blog site.</p><p>For example, if we create an account with the username guangzhengli, we will get our blog site which address is <a href=https://guangzhengli.github.io>https://guangzhengli.github.io</a>.</p><h3 id=create-repository-for-github-pages>Create repository for GitHub Pages</h3><p>You can find the full tutorial in the <a href=https://pages.github.com/>GitHub Pages Doc</a>. It just need <a href=https://github.com/new>create a new repository</a> with the repository name <code>username.github.io</code>.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/guangzhengli/PicURL@master/uPic/j0eHDj.png alt=j0eHDj></p><h3 id=actions>Actions</h3><p>There two ways to deploy blog used GitHub pages, one is to push directly to <a href=https://pages.github.com/>GitHub Pages</a>, and the other is to generate static page code on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. The code is available at <a href=https://github.com/guangzhengli/hugo-ladder-exampleSite/tree/master/.github/workflows>https://github.com/guangzhengli/hugo-ladder-exampleSite/tree/master/.github/workflows</a>.</p><p>If you did not clone the configured repository: <a href=https://github.com/guangzhengli/hugo-ladder-exampleSite>https://github.com/guangzhengli/hugo-ladder-exampleSite</a>. You need to create a new folder <code>.github/workflows</code> and add the new file <code>gh-pages.yml</code> file.</p><p><details class=toggle><summary markdown=span>Click to show the code</summary><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yml data-lang=yml><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#f92672>name</span>: <span style=color:#ae81ff>generate github pages to gh-pages branch</span>
